# 136-Capstone-Project

LiveFresh Ltd is a dynamic company that manufactures and sells five products that belong in the categories of refreshments and energy drinks. The company has six different stores in five big cities in Greece. It is in the process of identifying valuable changes in order to increase profitability and is also looking to expand its business by opening more stores in the same cities. 

Essentially, the company is looking for a deeply analysis of the sales performance; for instance, they would like to know whether the seasonality and geography variables have influence on the sales. Additionally, LiveFresh is looking to predict the demand of the products and identify the most appropriate cities to allocate the new shops. 

An analysis of the dataset containing information of sales for a period of six years in six different stores across the country could help to identify trends and summarization. In this project, we propose to solve the problem by combining the techniques of Regression and Predictive Analysis.
